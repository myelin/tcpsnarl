This is a set of Python bindings for the program "Snarl".  Snarl was inspired by Growl
for mac OSX and was written by Chris Peel.

The module is PySnarl.  Inside this module there are functions for all the sn* functions
in the snarl API.  This api can be found at:

  	http://www.fullphat.net/developer/developerGuide/api/index.html
  
Using these functions is simple:

	import PySnarl
	if PySnarl.snGetVersion() != False:
		(major, minor) = PySnarl.snGetVersion()
		print "Found Snarl version",str(major)+"."+str(minor),"running."
		PySnarl.snShowMessage("Test Message", "Hello World!")
	else:
		print "Sorry Snarl does not appear to be running"

This can also be found in the example.py found in this directory.
